# Global Digest
Amidst the diverse information circulating worldwide, the goal is to clearly deliver truly essential information, transcending multi-language barriers, to Japanese speakers in real-time.
Conventionally, Japanese speakers have needed to read and translate multi-language news to obtain the latest overseas information. Our system, "Global Digest," automates this process.

## Summary
"Global Digest" is an information delivery system that overcomes multi-language barriers to provide **truly essential global information** to Japanese speakers in real-time.
When a user enters their area of interest in Japanese, the system automatically collects news articles in multiple languages.
AI agents (Agentic AI Framework) autonomously perform the searching, summarizing, and translating of these articles.
This eliminates the inefficiency of information gathering, allowing users to receive the latest global news as a Japanese digest via email, regardless of their linguistic abilities, thereby reducing the information gap and increasing productivity.

## Global Digest: Core Capabilities (Planned)
Global Digest: Core Capabilities (Planned)
"Global Digest" is an RPA-type information delivery system designed to provide the latest global information to Japanese speakers. Based on keywords specified by the user, it automatically collects news articles published in multiple languages worldwide. A chain of AI agents performs language detection and summarizes the articles in their original language. It then has the capability to translate the summary into Japanese. Ultimately, these Japanese digests are automatically delivered to the user via email, dramatically improving information gathering productivity.
